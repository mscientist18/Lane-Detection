Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. 
This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.

In this Project, we have built a OpenCV project to detect lane lines in real-time. 
We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. 
To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane.
